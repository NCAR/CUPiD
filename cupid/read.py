"""
This module provides functions for reading YAML files and working with intake catalogs.

Functions:
    - read_yaml(path_to_yaml): Read a YAML file and return its content as a dictionary.
    - get_collection(path_to_catalog, **kwargs): Get a collection of datasets from an
                     intake catalog based on specified criteria.
