# Running Standalone CUPiD (for existing CESM datasets)
CUPiD can be run either independently or via the CESM workflow. If you want to run CUPiD as part of a CESM case submission, we recommend looking at the [Running CUPiD via CESM Workflow](https://ncar.github.io/CUPiD/run_cesm.html) page. If you already have CESM data that you want to analyze, and don't plan on running CESM to generate a case, you have come to the right place!

## Setup
Install CUPiD's analysis and infrastructure environments per the [usual setup instructions](https://ncar.github.io/CUPiD/index.html#installing).

Activate the `cupid-infrastructure` environment:

``` bash
conda activate cupid-infrastructure
```

## Adjust CUPiD configuration
Update the [CUPiD configuration file](https://ncar.github.io/CUPiD/config.html) with values relevant to your case.

``` bash
cd examples/key_metrics
```

## Request resources
Request resources-- eg, at NCAR, this may be useful:

``` bash
qinteractive -l select=1:ncpus=12:mem=120GB
```

See more details for resource requests on [tips and tricks for running at NCAR](https://ncar.github.io/CUPiD/ncar_tips.html).

## Postprocessing of Files
### Run Timeseries, if desired
``` bash
cupid-timeseries
```

### Run Remapping, if desired
[Coming soon](https://github.com/NCAR/CUPiD/pull/251)

``` bash
cupid-remap
```

## Run Diagnostics
### Running External Diagnostics
One feature of CUPiD is that it is possible to [run external diagnostic packages](https://ncar.github.io/CUPiD/run_external_diags.html) using CUPiD's helper scripts that automatically generate necessary configuration files for a variety of external packages using the CUPiD configuration file. Additionally, CUPiD is set up to integrate output from these packages directly into one location where all CUPiD output is viewed.
Packages that are integrated into CUPiD:
* ADF
* CVDP
* LDF
* ILAMB

### Running CUPiD Diagnostics
CUPiD's main example for generating diagnostics is `examples/key-metrics`. Other examples with various sets of diagnostic notebooks from `nblibrary` are also available, or you can make your own example describing a different set of notebooks-- or even [add your own](https://ncar.github.io/CUPiD/contributors_guide.html)!

This will require multiple compute cores:

``` bash
$ cupid-diagnostics
$ cupid-webpage  # Will build HTML from Jupyter Book
```
#### CUPiD Options
Most of CUPiD's configuration is done via the `config.yml` file, but there are a few command line options as well:

```bash
(cupid-infrastructure) $ cupid-diagnostics -h
Usage: cupid-diagnostics [OPTIONS] CONFIG_PATH

  Main engine to set up running all the notebooks.

Options:
  -s, --serial        Do not use LocalCluster objects
  -atm, --atmosphere  Run atmosphere component diagnostics
  -ocn, --ocean       Run ocean component diagnostics
  -lnd, --land        Run land component diagnostics
  -ice, --seaice      Run sea ice component diagnostics
  -glc, --landice     Run land ice component diagnostics
  -rof, --river-runoff Run river runoff component diagnostics
  --config_path       Path to the YAML configuration file containing specifications for notebooks (default config.yml)
  -h, --help          Show this message and exit.
```

##### Running in serial
By default, several of the example notebooks provided use a dask `LocalCluster` object to run in parallel.
However, the `--serial` option will pass a logical flag to each notebook that can be used to skip starting the cluster.

```py3
# Spin up cluster (if running in parallel)
client=None
if not serial:
  cluster = LocalCluster(**lc_kwargs)
  client = Client(cluster)

client
```

##### Specifying components

If no component flags are provided, all component diagnostics listed in `config.yml` will be executed by default. Multiple flags can be used together to select a group of components, for example: `cupid-diagnostics -ocn -ice`.

## View output
After the last step is finished, you can use Jupyter to view generated notebooks in `${CUPID_ROOT}/examples/key-metrics/computed_notebooks`
or you can view `${CUPID_ROOT}/examples/key-metrics/computed_notebooks/_build/html/index.html` in a web browser.
If you're at NCAR, you may also want to check out the [FastX visualization tool](https://ncar.github.io/CUPiD/ncar_tips.html#looking-at-output)

## Clean computed notebook directory
Furthermore, to clean the `computed_notebooks` folder which was generated by the `cupid-diagnostics` and `cupid-webpage` commands, you can run the following command:

``` bash
$ cupid-clean
```

This will clean the `computed_notebooks` folder which is at the location pointed to by the `run_dir` variable in the `config.yml` file.
