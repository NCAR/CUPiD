This directory contains three conda environment files:

1. dev-environment.yml: this creates (cupid-dev), which provides cupid-run and cupid-build,
                        and lets users update the main CUPiD code in cupid/

2. cupid-analysis.yml: this creates (cupid-analysis), the environment all scripts and notebooks
                       run in

3. docs.yml: this creates (cupid-docs), which is used by github actions to build
             https://ncar.github.io/CUPiD
